---

I like programming, writing, and Open Source. I'm interested in Linux, Browsers, Web Performance, Open Access to the Internet and all things JavaScript.

This website is a collection of random thoughts, observations, and ideas on a variety of topics.

I'm also on Twitter as [@tbmoyo](https://twitter.com/tbmoyo).
