metaDesc: 'The blog and website of Tawanda Moyo'
---

I like programming, writing, and contributing to Open Source. I'm interested in Linux, Browsers, Web Performance, Open Access to the Internet and all things JavaScript.

On occasion I dabble in electronics.

This website is a collection of random thoughts, observations, and ideas on a variety of topics. If there is a unifying theme it's an endless, childlike curiosity of the world of how the world came to be, and how it works in the age of the computer.

For more about what I'm doing now, check out my [now page](https://tawanda.dev/now).

I'm also on Twitter as [@tbmoyo](https://twitter.com/tbmoyo).
